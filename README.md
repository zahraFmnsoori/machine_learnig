here i put my machine learning and deep learning training code. just for fun! im not an expert!


Machine Learning for Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of machine learning to a neuroscience dataset, developed as part of my master’s research in cognitive neuroscience.

## Purpose
The notebook implements a machine learning model to analyze a سهئحمث datases. It showcases my skills in data preprocessing, model training, and visualization, aligned with my research goals.

## Tools
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, MNE-Python (optional), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project was created to demonstrate my coding and machine learning skills for a neuroscience school application. It reflects my experience in applying Python for neuroimaging and cognitive research. Future updates will include additional analyses, such as fMRI processing or fuzzy cognitive mapping models.
