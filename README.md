# introduction to python and machine_learnig/ deep learning

here i put my python learning notebook and machine learning code. 

first read and review python if you are not familiar with it, its simple and well taught. then start learning Machine Learning for Data Analysis.


## Purpose
The notebook implements a python basics and machine learning to analyze a datases. 

## Tools
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, MNE-Python (optional), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or colab

## Notes
This project was created to demonstrate my coding and machine learning skills for a neuroscience school application. It reflects my experience in applying Python for neuroimaging and cognitive research. Future updates will include additional analyses, such as fMRI processing or fuzzy cognitive mapping models.
